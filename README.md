  A minimalistic and responsive UI for easy email verification.

- **Real-Time Feedback** ⏱️  
  Displays validation results categorized as:
  - **Valid** ✅ : Email address exists and is valid.
  - **Invalid** ❌ : Email address does not exist or is undeliverable.
  - **Error** ⚠️ : Temporary or server-related issues encountered during verification (e.g., no MX records, unreachable server).
